### Hi there, traveler! ðŸ‘‹

I am a first year [CAPP](https://capp.cs.uchicago.edu/) candidate at the [University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) and the [University of Chicago Department of Computer Science](https://cs.uchicago.edu/). I currently work as a Research Engineer at the [Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation at the University of Chicago](https://miurban.uchicago.edu/) helping researchers do their work more efficiently.

Previously, I worked as a data scientist and occasionally as a data engineer for [ConsiliumBots](https://www.consiliumbots.com), an NGO that leverages economic theory and technology to make navigation in education markets easier for families and students. I was also a Predoctoral Fellow (a synonym for research assistant) at Yale's [Tobin Center for Economic Policy](https://economics.yale.edu/tobin-center) for [Christopher Neilson](https://christopherneilson.github.io), [Seth Zimmerman](https://som.yale.edu/faculty/seth-zimmerman), and [John Eric Humphries](https://johnerichumphries.com/) where I wore many different hats on the daily.

I completed my B.A. in Economics with a minor in Sociology at [Southern Connecticut State University](http://southernct.edu/), graduating in December 2016.

My own interests lie within the intersection of the fields of education, public policy, computer science and technology.
