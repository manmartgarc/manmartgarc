### Hi there, traveler! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working as a data engineer at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), where I focus on building large-scale, efficient, and maintainable data and machine learning pipelines.

Back in June 2023 I graduated from the [MSCAPP](https://capp.cs.uchicago.edu/) program, a graduate degree offered by the [University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) and the [University of Chicago Department of Computer Science](https://cs.uchicago.edu/). The [curriculum](https://capp.uchicago.edu/curriculum/) offers a high degree of flexibility, allowing students to specialize; I chose to focus on computer science, machine learning and software engineering. While a student, I worked as a Research Engineer at the [Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation at the University of Chicago](https://miurban.uchicago.edu/) helping researchers do their work more efficiently and maintainable.

Before graduate school I worked as a data scientist and occasionally as a data engineer for [ConsiliumBots](https://www.consiliumbots.com), an NGO that leverages economic theory and technology to make navigation in education markets easier for families and students. I was also a Predoctoral Fellow (a synonym for research assistant) at Yale's [Tobin Center for Economic Policy](https://tobin.yale.edu/) for [Christopher Neilson](https://christopherneilson.github.io), [Seth Zimmerman](https://som.yale.edu/faculty/seth-zimmerman), and [John Eric Humphries](https://johnerichumphries.com/) where I cut my teeth in the trenches of applied microeconomics.

I completed a B.A. in Economics from [Southern Connecticut State University](http://southernct.edu/), graduating in December 2016.
