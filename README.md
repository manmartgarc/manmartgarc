### Hi there traveler ðŸ‘‹

I am a first year [CAPP](https://capp.cs.uchicago.edu/) candidate at the [University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/). I work as a data scientist and occasionally as a data engineer for [ConsiliumBots](https://www.consiliumbots.com), an NGO that leverages economic theory and technology to make navigation in education markets easier for families and students. I also work as a Research Engineer at the [Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation at the University of Chicago](https://miurban.uchicago.edu/) on the [Million Neighborhoods](https://miurban.uchicago.edu/2019/11/14/millionneighborhoodsmap/) initiative.

Previously I was a Predoctoral Fellow (a synonym for research assistant) at Yale's [Tobin Center for Economic Policy](https://economics.yale.edu/tobin-center) for [Christopher Neilson](https://christopherneilson.github.io) and [John Eric Humphries](https://johnerichumphries.com/) where I developed tools to assist the research team and performed statistical data analysis.

I completed my B.A. in Economics at [Southern Connecticut State University](http://southernct.edu/), graduating in December 2016. Throughout my undergraduate degree I worked at a small local company as a business analyst where I learned some of the pragmatic ruggedness that often comes handy in academic research.

My own interests lie within the intersection of the fields of education, public policy, computer science and technology.
